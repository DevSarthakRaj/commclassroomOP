# Community Classroom is OP

- Kunal Kushwaha says that this community is amazing.
- More power to kunal. love the work which your are doing for the community.
- Anirudh Sharma finds the Community Classroom initiative really great!
- Sarthak Raj Shrestha says that he had taken some tutorials from youtube and other resources for Git and Github but Kunal's way of teaching is amazing and to the point ,you cannot get better than this to teach git and github . This tutorial though 1hour is packed with so much info ...taking me longer than expected . Came across this gem today and will try other courses from Kunal after this.Love you Kunal.
